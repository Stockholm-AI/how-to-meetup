# meetup #2
140 people

96 beers (systembolaget)
24 x 33cl cokes
2 x 3L wine (only half used, probably much due to the lack of plastic cups)
2 x 2L fanta

16 big pizza hut + 12 small pizza hut (they went out really quickly)

40 plastic cups (went away really quick, being without plastic cups probably skewed some of this data)

Later:
18 x 33cl sparkly water (peopled seemed to enjoy them)
24 beers (lidl)
7 ordinary pizzas later (held out 2 for speakers and organizers, since they didn't get any at first)
